# Employee Tracker

## Description

The challenge was to develop an Employee Tracker App that allows the user to view, add and update departments, roles, and employee information. The application uses inquirer npm to prompt the user in the terminal. Once the selections are made, the application imports data from the employeetracker database, which contains 3 tables, department, role, and employee. Schema and seeds files were created to construct the database using MySQL. Different functions in the server.js file handle different dabatase queries to retrieve and join tables. This application is still a work in progress.

## Installation

To utilize the Employee Tracker, please install Node.js and the following npms: inquirer, mysql2, and dotenv.
